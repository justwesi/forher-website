                        First day of class kayong dalawa ni angge kasama ko non at first impression ko talaga sayo non is parang typical girl lang talaga ganyan, wala pa siguro ako nakikita non na kadetalye. 1st week palang ng school nagiging makulit at madaldal na ako kahit di ko pa naman alam ugali nyo, mga ayaw nyo ganyan. Dahil nga rin doon nagkaroon na agad tayo ng conflict sa ating dalawa dahil lang doon sa notebook na paulit-ulit kong hinihiram. nasaktan ako non dahil halatang iritable ka katabi ako at umiiwas ka. Lumilipat ako ng upuan non dahil wala naman ako makausap sa inyo at hindi ko rin naman gugustuhin na si jeff ang kabff ko HAHA. Tuwing asa harap ako lagi hindi ko rin alam bakit ako tumitingin sa likod at chinicheck kung kamusta kayo ni angge, lagi lang ganon everyday tinitignan ko lang kayo dalawa if okay kayo kasi ayoko lang makaistorbo tapos natatakot pa ako sayo non. Pero sa tuwing tumitingin ako doon ko nakikita ung pagngiti mo (sorry kung cheezy ah), ung mata kapag tatawa at nagandahan talaga sayo non ng genuinely lang talaga. Nagulat din ako sa katalinuhan mo siyempre ayon. Marami kayong naging friends ni angge na wala ako ron and that's okay lang naman. mas lalonh napalayo ako sayo siyempre, sa pagiging cm ganyan. Hanggang sa naging kaibigan ko na sila cas at rose anne. Sa kanila ko unang sinabi na parang nagugustuhan kita pero di pa ako sure kasi tumitingin ka lang din naman sa akin at hindi ko alam kung ano ibig sabihin non tapos kapag may time na mag-uusap tayo saglit lang tas iiwas ka na uli makikipag kulitan sa iba. Tapos ayon meron tayong whole section activity ba yon. tapos diba alam nga nila rose an na gusto kita, sinasabihan nila akong hindi ikaw gusto non kasi may lalaking gusto yon. Pinipilit ko siya na sabihin sakin sino yon hanggang sa ako nalang din nakaalam kung sino. Wala naman akong ginawa non, inunfriend lang naman kita. kasi bigat sa damdamin ganyan, ay btw si tricia alam na alam din paano ako nag aassume sayo dati. scripted lang din ung kunwari finorward niya sayo ng di ko alam, pero alam ko un kasi ako nag utos non na paalam mo nalang sa kanya kung bakit ko siya na unfriend. tapos dahil nga sobrang sama ng loob ko sayo pa non, sila rose an at cas lang nagiging friend ko lalo na si rose an. Onting kwento lang don sa naramdaman ko kay rose an. masasabi ko na what we had was a mistake, dahil finorced ko ung sarili ko magmahal ng may gusto sa akin porket hindi lang ako nagkachance sayo dati non. kumbaga nadala rin ako ng excitement dahil may taong gusto sakin at maybe ito na ung time na pagbigyan ko sarili ko kasi first ko lang din iyon. parang forced relationship nangyari, though naging mabuti ako, sweet, green flag pa as in nung una. during relationship meron pa rin tayong interactions kasi dahil classmates ganyan. and hindi ko alam kahit na nagkaroon ako ng sama ng loob sayo dati, bat di ko kaya magsungit sayo man lang, iisnob ka ganyan. Mas takot pa rin ako at nahihiya sayo actually, at walang halong sama ng loob o galit tuwing kinakausap mo ako e. after ilang ano ewan ko, naririnig ko na may gusto ka na nga which is ung gr.12 na lalaki, tas ayon minsan napapansin kita umiiyak ka kay ma'am bern. kumbaga may sarili na tayong mundo that time at parang wala nalang tayo sa isat isa, though tinitignan pa rin naman kita minsan. Punta tayo sa pa gr.12 na, nagulat nung tinignan ko ung cm ko kasi andon ka na naman sabi ko. sabi ko wala na araw-araw na naman akong mahihiya nito. Tapos fast forward na, habang tumatagal dahil nga pilit nga ung nagawa ko kay rose ane, narereiaize ko sa sarili ko na ayoko na, ayoko na magpretend na mahal na mahal ko siya na siya na yung gusto kong makasama ba hanggang college hanggang magtapos. So ayon, i really have a mistake, nasaktan ko rin siya pero kailangan ko rin tanggapin na ganon na nangyari e. tiniis ko pamandalian na in relationship pa rin kasi naaawa ako sa kanya, and one time pumasok ka na naman sa usapan at yun ung parang nagpabalik sakin sa dati. sabi niya kasi nakakwentuhan niya raw si tricia at sabi raw ni tricia na (hindi ko kiniclaim na totoo to ah, sinusulat ko lang dito ung mga nalalaman ko), parang nagustuhan mo rin daw ako dati pero baka matulad lang daw sa ex mo na girl din dati. Ayon tapos sabi niya sa akin ano raw nararamdaman ko, eh siyempre ako na forced na naman ako na i assure siya dahil I can't tell the truth. sabi ko ano ngayon eh matagal naman na yon at wala na kaming connection ni jelaine. Pero deep inside napaisip ako non, malalim na isip, binalikan ko ung mga nangyari dati satin, sabi ko ano ba ung namissed ko bakit di nagkaroon ng sign, di ako pinagbigyan makilala ka, sabi ko maybe may possiblity pa dati kung umamin ako sa kanya. Tapos ngayon ang fucked up ng love life ko, hindi namn ito ung ginusto ko. Pero after all, tinanggap ko hiniwalayan ko for good, sabi ko kilala ko na sarili ko, alam ko kung sino gusto ko makasama, sino pa rin ung genuine na gusto kong tao. Hahanapin ko muna ung peace na kailangan ko, maybe after grad,

     Spinning out on what to say or what to do
     Finding reasons for my constant change in mood
     I'll see it to believe it," but who knows the actual truth 
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

    'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches
     And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets
     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     Find it hard to say, I know that I'm alright
     Took a while for me to finally realize
     That when I see it, I'll believe it, giving me a peace of mind
     I'm sure now, I'm surе

     'Cause days blend to one whеn I'm on the right beaches
     And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets
     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     'Cause some days I'm afraid to fall down
     But I understand the coming outcome
     Pick it up if I allow it
     Can't help it, can't help

     'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches
     And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets
     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
     When we had first met in the fall
     Guess it's something you learn to accept
     When I've been a mess it's not your fault
     But I keep forgetting it's what we do

     I missed the train again
     I called your name
     As if you'd drive it back
     I swear you're in my head
     Throughout the day
     I can say that for a fact
     Know we had better days
     But to keep me sane
     I guess that this is just another love song
     About you
     Just another love song
     About you

     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do

     I'm running over sentences at times
     I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
     Yet the words to describe you aren't so hard to find
     Like a good quote from a book that I've memorized
     But I keep forgetting just what to do

     I missed the train again
     I called your name
     As if you'd drive it back
     I swear you're in my head
     Throughout the day
     I can say that for a fact
     Know we had better days
     But to keep me sane
     I guess that this is just another love song
     About you
     Just another love song
     About you

     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do

     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do

     Every second counts
     I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
     All these little games
     You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah
     Every minute counts
     I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
     Can you figure me out?
     Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

     Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
     I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
     Can you see me using everything to hold back?
     I guess this could be worse
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags

     Pour your glass of wine
     Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah)
     Cases under the bed
     Spill it open, let it rush to my head
     I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
     Savor this with everything I have inside of me
     I'm not the type to run
     I know that we're having fun
     But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed

     Tell you how I felt
     Sugar coated melting in your mouth
     Pardon my emotions
     I should probably keep it all to myself
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me

     Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time

     Are you into me, like I'm into you?
     Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you?
     You're so close, and yet so far
     I wonder how you look when you're in the dark

     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake

     Played you DOOM, man, you play Drake
     You left crumbs all on my face
     Taste like RiRi, taste like Bey
     Bought you Fenty, took his place
     Rolled your weed and kissed your face
     Man, wanna smoke you out like all-day
     Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can
     You be all down for the boy, no mass
     Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old
     Made a hundred grand and went broke, I'm an asshole
     Clairo, will you be my real or my fake though?
     Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so
     Frame my life and take my soul
     Make me crazy, make me old
     Save me roses, text my phone
     Fake like rappers, fake like jokes
     I know

     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake

     At the best of times, I'm lonely in my mind
     But I can find something to show you
     If you have got the time why would I rely on the things that I did right?
     She said, "I gave you four years of my life"
     So

     What about these feelings I've got?
     We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
     What about these feelings I've got?
     I couldn't be more in love

     I could have been a great line
     I could have been a sign or overstayed my time
     Say what's on your mind
     Maybe I'll rely on all the things that made it right
     Because I'd give you all the years of my life
     So


     What about these feelings I've got?
     We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
     But what about these feelings I've got?
     I couldn't be more in love

     And what about these feelings I've got? (Ooh)

     And Danny ran into some complications
     He falls asleep during conversations
     He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
     The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

     And all I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     And Danny says we're living in a simulation

     But he works in a petrol station (selling petrol)
     He says it all began with his operation
     And I know you think you're sly, but you need some imagination

     And all I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     All I do is sit and drink without you
     If I choose, then I'll lose
     Distract my brain from the terrible news
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     I can't stop sweating or control my feet
     Got a twenty-stone monkey that I just can't beat
     I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
     And there's a feeling you're replacing embrace
     It's true that

     All I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     All I do is sit and drink without you
     If I choose, then I'll lose
     Distract my brain from the terrible news
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     Oh, and Johnny got a job in a bank, I think
     Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
     I feel sick, and I know I that I'll lose but
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not, it's not)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not living, if it's not with you)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not, it's not)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not living, if it's not with you)
