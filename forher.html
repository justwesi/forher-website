                        First day of class kayong dalawa ni angge kasama ko no'n at first impression ko talaga sayo is parang typical girl lang talaga ganyan, wala pa ako nakikita non na ka-detalye. 1st week palang ng school nagiging makulit at madaldal na ako kahit di ko pa naman alam ugali nyo, mga ayaw nyo ganyan. Dahil nga rin doon nagkaroon na agad tayo ng conflict sa ating dalawa dahil lang sa notebook ng gen-bio na paulit-ulit kong hinihiram. Siyempre nasaktan ako no'n (konti) dahil halatang iritable ka katabi ako at umiiwas ka. Lumilipat ako ng upuan no'n dahil wala naman ako makausap sa inyo at hindi ko rin naman gugustuhin na si jeff ang ka-bff ko HAHA. Tuwing asa harap ako lagi, hindi ko rin alam bakit ako tumitingin sa likod at chinicheck kung kamusta kayo ni angge. Lagi lang ganon everyday, tinitignan ko lang kayo dalawa if okay kayo kasi ayoko lang makaistorbo tapos natatakot pa ako sayo no'n. Pero sa tuwing tumitingin ako doon ko nakikita ung pagngiti mo (sorry kung cheezy ah), ung mata mo kapag tatawa at nagandahan talaga sayo no'n ng genuinely talaga like walang pilit. Nagulat din ako sa katalinuhan mo siyempre ayon. Marami kayong naging friends ni angge na wala ako ron and okay lang naman sakin iyon. Mas lalo lang napalayo ako sayo siyempre, sa pagiging cm ganyan. Hanggang sa naging kaibigan ko na sila cas at rose anne. Sa kanila ko unang sinabi na parang nagugustuhan kita pero di pa ako sure kasi tumitingin ka lang din naman sa akin at hindi ko alam kung ano ibig sabihin non tapos kapag may time na mag-uusap tayo saglit lang tas iiwas ka na uli, makikipag kulitan sa iba. Tapos ayon meron tayong whole section activity ba yon, tapos diba alam nga nila rose an na gusto kita no'n. Sinasabihan nila akong hindi ako yung gusto mo kasi may lalaking kang gusto. Pinipilit ko siya na sabihin sakin sino yon hanggang sa ako nalang din nakaalam kung sino. Wala naman akong ginawa non, inunfriend lang naman kita HAHAHAHA. Btw si tricia alam na alam din paano ako mag assume sayo dati. Scripted lang din ung kunwari finorward niya sayo ng di ko alam, pero alam ko yon kasi ako nag utos na paalam nalang nya sayo kung bakit kita unfriend. Punta tayo sa pa gr.12 na, nagulat ako nung tinignan ko ung cm ko kasi andon ka na naman sabi ko at sabi ko wala na araw-araw na naman akong mahihiya nito.  Pero dahil nga busy tayo nung gr. 12, parang nawalan ako ng interest sa love life ganyan at puro friends lang nakakapag pasaya sa akin. Though meron ka naging love life kaso saglit lang din. Wala akong naging problem no'n dahil friend ko rin dati yung tao na yon at nasa isip ko no'n dati ay hopefully magtagal kayo at sumaya kana. Pero nagulat ako kasi ganon mga nangyari (labas na ako ron JAHAH). Buti nga rin hindi pala kayo sa isa't isa diba HAHA, pero ayon. Katapusan ata ng school year, bago grumaduate parang bigla-bigla nalang napapansin ko na naman yung ngiti mo at mata mo tuwing nagkakatinginan tayo. Ewan ko ba pero ang simple mo lang gumalaw at wala namang arte sa ugali o ano, alam mo yung parang walang bad energy kapag kasama ka. Iniisip ko palang yung ganon parang iniisip ko na, na ang swerte talaga ng mapapasayo at iti-treat ka ng tama. Doon palang nagkakaroon na uli ako ng secret crush sayo no'n kahit complicated naman tayong dalawa dahil wala tayong deep connection sa isa't isa at ako kakagaling lang sa relationship tas ikaw naman kakagaling lang sa ginawa sayo nung taong iyon. May sasabihin sana ako sayo nung graduation day, sasabihin ko sana na ayon nga gusto kita. Kaso naunahan na naman ng kaba. So, confession ko ito sayo ng walang kaba at ng walang takot sa mga hindi ko nasabi mula gr.11 to 12. It's the truth how I really felt about you dati pa. I'll explain everything about my past also.

                    <p>Alam kong kilala mo na ako sa pangalan ko at kung paano ako gumalaw at magsalita. Past, onting kwento lang don sa naramdaman ko dati sa taong iyon. Masasabi ko na in the first place what we had was a mistake, dahil finorced ko ung sarili ko magmahal ng may gusto sa akin just because hindi lang ako nagkachance sayo dati. kumbaga nadala rin ako ng excitement dahil may taong gusto sa akin at nasa isip ko that time maybe yun na ung time na pagbigyan ko sarili ko kasi first ko lang din iyon. Forced relationship nangyari, though naging mabuti ako, sweet, green flag pa as in nung una. Habang tumatagal dahil nga ganon, narerealize ko sa sarili ko na nakakapagod din pala na magpretend na okay lang sa akin lahat ganyan, na ginusto ko yon, na siya na siya na yung gusto kong makasama hanggang college hanggang magtapos. So ayon, i really have a mistake, nasaktan ko rin yung tao pero kailangan ko rin tanggapin sa sarili ko na ganon na nangyari e. One time pumasok ka na naman sa usapan at yun ung parang nagpabalik sakin sa dati. Sabi niya kasi nakakwentuhan niya raw si tricia at sabi raw ni tricia na (hindi ko kini-claim na totoo to ah, sinusulat ko lang dito ung mga nalalaman ko), parang nagustuhan mo rin daw ako dati pero baka matulad lang daw sa ex mo na girl din dati. Ayon tapos sabi niya sa akin ano raw nararamdaman ko, sabi ko ano ngayon eh matagal naman na yon at wala na kaming connection ni jelaine. Pero deep inside napaisip ako non, binalikan ko ung mga nangyari dati satin. Sabi ko ano ba ung namissed ko bakit di nagkaroon ng sign, di ako pinagbigyan makilala ka, sabi ko maybe may chance pa dati kung umamin ako sa iyo (too many what if's). Tapos ngayon ang fucked up ng love life ko, hindi namn ito ung ginusto ko. Pero after all, tinanggap ko hiniwalayan ko for good, sabi ko kilala ko na sarili ko, alam ko kung sino gusto ko makasama, sino pa rin ung genuine na gusto kong tao na walang pilit. After months, sabi ko kailangan ko na ng peace sa mind, sa environment ko dahil nga andami ng issues, maybe after grad i can finally find my peace kasi malalayo na ako sa mga taong judger. And ngayon I am free, happy. And ever since grumaduate, you're still the one I admire the most. Alam ko sa sarili ko wala na makakatapat sa pagtingin ko sayo tsaka ung pinaparamdam mo sa akin na hindi pilit ung pagkakagusto ko sayo. Pagiging ikaw mo lang sumasaya na ako kahit pa duh wala naman akong connection sayo tapos all this time di mo naman talaga alam nararamdaman ko para sayo kasi wala tayong chance to have chat. And alam kong malaki ung differences ng ugali natin kasi di talaga tayo complatible kahit saan e, not compatible rin para maging friends alam mo na rin yan. All I want to say is that I'm not defined by my past, but by who I am today, a healed, ready, and mentally stable person who knows exactly what I want for the future. And that’s you. You're the one I want, my biggest crush, and my inspiration. And My intentions are clear: I want to get to know you genuinely. I want to be part of the love you already feel to your family and friends. Be honest, kind, and be respectful in whatever decision you make. If I given the chance, I will definitely love you unconditionally.</p>

     Spinning out on what to say or what to do
     Finding reasons for my constant change in mood
     I'll see it to believe it," but who knows the actual truth 
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

    'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches
     And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets
     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     Find it hard to say, I know that I'm alright
     Took a while for me to finally realize
     That when I see it, I'll believe it, giving me a peace of mind
     I'm sure now, I'm surе

     'Cause days blend to one whеn I'm on the right beaches
     And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets
     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     'Cause some days I'm afraid to fall down
     But I understand the coming outcome
     Pick it up if I allow it
     Can't help it, can't help

     'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches
     And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets
     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
     When we had first met in the fall
     Guess it's something you learn to accept
     When I've been a mess it's not your fault
     But I keep forgetting it's what we do

     I missed the train again
     I called your name
     As if you'd drive it back
     I swear you're in my head
     Throughout the day
     I can say that for a fact
     Know we had better days
     But to keep me sane
     I guess that this is just another love song
     About you
     Just another love song
     About you

     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do

     I'm running over sentences at times
     I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
     Yet the words to describe you aren't so hard to find
     Like a good quote from a book that I've memorized
     But I keep forgetting just what to do

     I missed the train again
     I called your name
     As if you'd drive it back
     I swear you're in my head
     Throughout the day
     I can say that for a fact
     Know we had better days
     But to keep me sane
     I guess that this is just another love song
     About you
     Just another love song
     About you

     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do

     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do

     Every second counts
     I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
     All these little games
     You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah
     Every minute counts
     I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
     Can you figure me out?
     Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

     Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
     I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
     Can you see me using everything to hold back?
     I guess this could be worse
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags

     Pour your glass of wine
     Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah)
     Cases under the bed
     Spill it open, let it rush to my head
     I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
     Savor this with everything I have inside of me
     I'm not the type to run
     I know that we're having fun
     But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed

     Tell you how I felt
     Sugar coated melting in your mouth
     Pardon my emotions
     I should probably keep it all to myself
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me

     Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time

     Are you into me, like I'm into you?
     Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you?
     You're so close, and yet so far
     I wonder how you look when you're in the dark

     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake

     Played you DOOM, man, you play Drake
     You left crumbs all on my face
     Taste like RiRi, taste like Bey
     Bought you Fenty, took his place
     Rolled your weed and kissed your face
     Man, wanna smoke you out like all-day
     Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can
     You be all down for the boy, no mass
     Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old
     Made a hundred grand and went broke, I'm an asshole
     Clairo, will you be my real or my fake though?
     Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so
     Frame my life and take my soul
     Make me crazy, make me old
     Save me roses, text my phone
     Fake like rappers, fake like jokes
     I know

     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
     You're just one click away, click away, click away

     At the best of times, I'm lonely in my mind
     But I can find something to show you
     If you have got the time why would I rely on the things that I did right?
     She said, "I gave you four years of my life"
     So

     What about these feelings I've got?
     We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
     What about these feelings I've got?
     I couldn't be more in love

     I could have been a great line
     I could have been a sign or overstayed my time
     Say what's on your mind
     Maybe I'll rely on all the things that made it right
     Because I'd give you all the years of my life
     So

     And Danny ran into some complications
     He falls asleep during conversations
     He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
     The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

     And all I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     And Danny says we're living in a simulation

     But he works in a petrol station (selling petrol)
     He says it all began with his operation
     And I know you think you're sly, but you need some imagination

     And all I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     All I do is sit and drink without you
     If I choose, then I'll lose
     Distract my brain from the terrible news
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     I can't stop sweating or control my feet
     Got a twenty-stone monkey that I just can't beat
     I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
     And there's a feeling you're replacing embrace
     It's true that

     All I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     All I do is sit and drink without you
     If I choose, then I'll lose
     Distract my brain from the terrible news
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     Oh, and Johnny got a job in a bank, I think
     Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
     I feel sick, and I know I that I'll lose but
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not, it's not)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not living, if it's not with you)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not, it's not)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
