                        Hi Leng! I made a confession website for you, I hope you will read it all, even if it's long, and I hope you understand my explanations regardless of how I construct my sentences. Sorry in advanced if the text alignment is not in the center (ang hirappp, nakailang adjust na aku sa code).  Plus sa mga picture mo cuz i don't have permission to you since I made this secretly, so i couldn't ask for a permission ofc pero sana it doesn't creep you out. Yun lang pease don't judge.üòÖ‚úåüèª

Soo.. I'm not really good at saying things directly, but I don't want to keep this to myself anymore, don't wanna be torpe and scared of being judge. I've been planning to confess to you after graduation pa actually. Yes i like you already back then but you know, fresh grads pa ng shs and going vacation, so it was a big break for us at that time. 

I just enjoyed the time I had and gave myself peace, had fun, try to forget things and took time to know fully know who I am, what I want, and how to keep move forward everyday. And ever since non, you are the only one I think about everyday (call it cheezy, cringe, corny but it's true) even though I don't see you everyday, I don't anything hear anything about you, nothing talaga because we don't have any connections to have a talk. But it just proves that I don't just like you because I like you. There's something more I realize why I like you so much and I'm so sure that you're the one I want to be able to (hopefully, if I'm given a chance) grow with someday, cause I don't want anybody else and there's no one like you. And dati pa naman e ramdam ko na, kaya pala never kong magawang magalit sayo, awayin ka, backstabbin ka ganon HAHAHAHAHA. Wala, sumasama lang loob ko sayo dati kapag masungit ka sakin tas nasisigawan, pero isang usap mo lanh uli sakin nagiging mabait tas nawawala yung sama ng loob ko.üòì

Yeah, that was the first gut na I wanted to confess. Second time was this July, dahil sinabi ko na sa mga kaibigan kong iba tas kay angge about sa feelings ko for you for a long time HAHAHAH. She supported me naman pero sabi nya "huwag mo na pakielaman un si jelaine, maayos na yon ngayon", sabi ko naman oo alam ko wala naman akong balak gustuhin ka para lang sirain diba. Tapos sabi nya pa "lahat kasi ng nagkakagusto kay leng hindi talaga nag wowork eh, tas nasasaktan siya", ayun hindi ko na matandaan yung response ko kasi andami naming deep talks.

After weeks, hindi ko na kaya kasi bigla-bigla nag pipinch yung heart Ko HAHAHAHA, sabi ko bigyan muna ako ng sign ni lord aamin na ako. Tas ayon naisipan ko na planuhin nalang, mas gusto ko kasi talaga mag confess in person kasi hindi ko kakayanin mag long message para umamin, kasi feeling ko mas seryoso kapag face fo face. Dinamay ko si angge, plinano namin yung inaya ka nya lumabas HAHAHAHAHA. kaya nga libre ko lahat pati pamasahe nya sana eh, tapos sa huli hindi naman natuloy dahil ayaw mo nga tas andon pa ung mga friends mo HAHAHAHAHA. Pero okay lang naman sakin kasi di ko naman pinipilit ung mga bagay na hindi talaga siguro para sa gabing yon. At least diba nagkaroon pa rin ako ng chance makita ka uli tas makausap. Iniisip ko nalang din na there's still another time to try.

And this is the last shot, I'm made this as a move, an effort agad to you dahil last na rin toh and finally asking you what your thoughts and feelings about me. My intentions are clear, I want you, I want to love you, your family, and even your real friends (pang 3rd sila). I love everything about you and there's no single thing that I don't like. I like Your personality, the way your mind think, the way you speak, your voice, your attractiveness like sa smile mo, yung smile mo talaga nakakapagkuha sakin e HAHAHAHA sanaol may killer smile. So I will take this risk and If I given a chance I will be good for you, for your mental health, I'll be here for you, i can be whatever you want and respect you, really respecting you, your whole self and your family cause I know your worth, sobrang laki ng worth mo and you are my dream. Baka isipin mo puro lang ako salita, well di ko 'to gagawin at sasabihin lahat if I didn't mean it. All i want is finally let you know what i really felt dati pa. Tapos pasukan ko na rin, so baka kapag di ko pa ito sinabi, baka hindi ko na talaga masabi.

Pero in the end, it's your choice. At tsaka di ko nga rin alam kung may nagugustuhan kang tao ngayon na iba or may kausap ko ngayon na more than a friend e. Pero ayon, just let me know, or depends cause i have a two questions later. About pala sa background and issues ko sa past maybe we can talk about that after or if I'm ready na, but it's past now and doesn't define who I was right now. And I don't really care what other people might think abt us if ever mannn, if ever man magkachance ako.

                    <p>You know my name, you know how i talk and what it's like to be with in person. I have a nice big family, i love them so much and when it comes to my love life and my choice of path sa course or career ay choice at decision ko na yon, wala naman silang pake doon at nirerespeto ano ang gusto ko. 

I have 4 real friends in my life, abi, denise, ben, at angge (ung iba casual friend lang). When it comes to my mental state right now ‚Äîhell yeah, I feel fine, happy, stable, and I am proud. Sa body clock ko nalang siguro nahihirapan pa ako mag adjust HAHAHAHA.

Changes malaki kasi from hindi alam gagawin dati, indicisive, kung sino-sino nalang magustuhan, naging problematic, I hurt people dati dahil lang hindi ko maamin na i don't want them, I'm a people pleaser. Pero as days goes by marerealize mo naman pagkakamali mo kasi gusto mo magbago eh or may nagpapabago sayo. So I accepted my mistakes dati and be myself at sundin nalang sa kung ano yung gusto talaga ng puso ko at san ako masaya at hindi sa gusto ng ibang tao. I'm sharing this to you kasi yun nga, i know your worth so I'm making sure na I'm a better for you kung makakapasok man ako sa life mo kahit na hindi tayo compatible, you know that, kahit nga ata sa pagiging friends hirap tayo. Pero kahit na kasi gusto talaga kita!! here a songs that reminded me of you, marami pa sanang kanta kaso yung structure dapat may pic ka kasi dapat sa gilid kaso wala na akong pic mo, nakita ko lang yang pic na yan sa mga gc ee. sowrryy‚úåüèªüòÖ</p>

     Spinning out on what to say or what to do
     Finding reasons for my constant change in mood
     I'll see it to believe it," but who knows the actual truth 
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

    'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches
     And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets
     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     Find it hard to say, I know that I'm alright
     Took a while for me to finally realize
     That when I see it, I'll believe it, giving me a peace of mind
     I'm sure now, I'm sur–µ

     'Cause days blend to one wh–µn I'm on the right beaches

     Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in
     'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure

     'Cause some days I'm afraid to fall down
     But I understand the coming outcome
     Pick it up if I allow it
     Can't help it, can't help

     I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
     When we had first met in the fall
     Guess it's something you learn to accept
     When I've been a mess it's not your fault
     But I keep forgetting it's what we do

     I missed the train again
     I called your name
     As if you'd drive it back
     I swear you're in my head
     Throughout the day
     I can say that for a fact
     Know we had better days
     But to keep me sane
     I guess that this is just another love song
     About you
     Just another love song
     About you

     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
     Do-do-do-do

     I'm running over sentences at times
     I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
     Yet the words to describe you aren't so hard to find
     Like a good quote from a book that I've memorized
     But I keep forgetting just what to do

     I missed the train again
     I called your name
     As if you'd drive it back
     I swear you're in my head
     Throughout the day
     I can say that for a fact
     Know we had better days
     But to keep me sane
     I guess that this is just another love song
     About you
     Just another love song
     About you

     Every second counts
     I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and
     All these little games
     You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah
     Every minute counts
     I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah
     Can you figure me out?
     Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

     Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time
     I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
     Can you see me using everything to hold back?
     I guess this could be worse
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags
     Walking out the door with your bags

     Pour your glass of wine
     Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah)
     Cases under the bed
     Spill it open, let it rush to my head
     I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners
     Savor this with everything I have inside of me
     I'm not the type to run
     I know that we're having fun
     But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed

     Tell you how I felt
     Sugar coated melting in your mouth
     Pardon my emotions
     I should probably keep it all to myself
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me
     Know you'd make fun of me

     Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you?
     You're so close, and yet so far

     You're just one click away, click away, click away

     Played you DOOM, man, you play Drake
     You left crumbs all on my face
     Taste like RiRi, taste like Bey
     Bought you Fenty, took his place
     Rolled your weed and kissed your face
     Man, wanna smoke you out like all-day
     Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can
     You be all down for the boy, no mass
     Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old
     Made a hundred grand and went broke, I'm an asshole
     Clairo, will you be my real or my fake though?
     Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so
     Frame my life and take my soul
     Make me crazy, make me old
     Save me roses, text my phone
     Fake like rappers, fake like jokes
     I know

     You're just one click away, click away, click away
     From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
     You're just one click away, click away, click away

     I could have been a great line
     I could have been a sign or overstayed my time

     And Danny ran into some complications
     He falls asleep during conversations
     He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
     The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

     And all I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     And Danny says we're living in a simulation

     But he works in a petrol station (selling petrol)
     He says it all began with his operation
     And I know you think you're sly, but you need some imagination

     And all I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     All I do is sit and drink without you
     If I choose, then I'll lose
     Distract my brain from the terrible news
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     I can't stop sweating or control my feet
     Got a twenty-stone monkey that I just can't beat
     I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
     And there's a feeling you're replacing embrace
     It's true that

     All I do is sit and think about you
     If I knew what you'd do
     Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     All I do is sit and drink without you
     If I choose, then I'll lose
     Distract my brain from the terrible news
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     Oh, and Johnny got a job in a bank, I think
     Danny spent the time trying to pack in the drinks for me
     I feel sick, and I know I that I'll lose but
     It's not living, if it's not with you

     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not, it's not)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not living, if it's not with you)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not, it's not)
     It's not living, if it's not with you (It's not, it's not)
     (It's not living, if it's not with you)
